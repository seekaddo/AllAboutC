Started learning C programming this sommer

I just started learning C rogramming and i love it but i need to becareful. 
I hope to improve and get to the guru or Ninja level.

I am using CLion from JetBrain, so that is why i have CMakelist at the beginning. Is kind of confusing but is lovely but you take your time and read the intro at their homepage.
